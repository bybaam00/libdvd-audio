** DONE Add basic debugging utilities
   These are stripped-down proof-of-concepts to show off how the library works
   and can be probed with Valgrind to ensure there's no bugs.
*** DONE dvda-debug-info
*** DONE dvda2wav
** DONE Add versioning to library
   Ensure major and minor version show up somewhere
** DONE Make both static and dynamic libraries
** DONE Add .pc file for pkg-config
   Make this consistent with other libraries like libcdio
** DONE Verify utilities for errors
   Run Valgrind over them to ensure there's no memory leaks
   or other access errors.
** DONE Add library documentation
*** DONE Add RST file for the web
** DONE Handle tracks that don't fall on packet boundaries
   The "start sector" field in the ATX_01_0.IFO file
   should indicate which sector in which ATS_01_X.AOB file
   the track starts on.

   Only sometimes tracks don't start on the first audio packet of the sector
   so one "puts the needle down" right in the middle of an MLP frame.
   Sometimes tracks don't even start in that sector at all
   for a bit of added stupidity.

   This is why the previous implementation treated the MLP tracks
   as one big stream and split it at rip-time by PTS ticks
   just to overcome that silliness, but individual tracks in an
   MLP stream may not be consistent either in terms of stream parameters.

   Tracks will be handled correctly to match the API this time around
   via as much stream probing as it takes.
** TODO Handle end of tracks correctly
   I'd been converting PTS ticks to PCM frames and using that as the total track
   length, but that's not quite right either.

   Need to figure out a more accurate way to find a track's end.
* TODO Finish version 1.1
** TODO Add format documentation
   Overhaul the documentation on how to read and decode DVD-A discs
   to be a bit more comprehensive.
** TODO Add some optimization
   see if there's any obvious bits that could be optimized
** TODO Add better error reporting
   It might be useful to generate specific error codes
   when some problem occurs opening things or during decoding.
